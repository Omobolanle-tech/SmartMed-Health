🏥 SmartMed Health – Digital Patient Appointment & Feedback System
📌 Project Overview

SmartMed Health is a digital solution designed to improve hospital operations by replacing manual appointment booking and unstructured patient feedback collection. The project provides a user-friendly platform for patients to schedule appointments and share feedback, while also helping hospital staff manage schedules efficiently.

This project was developed as part of my Business Analysis Internship at Utiva, applying end-to-end BA practices in a real-world simulation.
